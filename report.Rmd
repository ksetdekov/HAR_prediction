## Task:
* The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. 
* This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. 
* You should create a report describing how you built your model, 
* how you used cross validation, 
* what you think the expected out of sample error is, and 
* why you made the choices you did. 
* You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
